uri-element [![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/uri-element.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/bo/uri-element)
=========

The `uri-element` provides access to the [URI.js](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/) library via HTML imports. This makes it possible
to safely include the library from multiple web components, and have only one copy included after vulcanization.
